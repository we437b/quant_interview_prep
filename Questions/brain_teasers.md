> ANSWER
Let us consider that each of the jugs consider 100 units of pure water and pure alcohol. Now given that we have moved a modes quantity, lets say 10 percent of the liquid volume, of water has been transferred to the alcohol jug, and thoroughly mixed. Now, we have approximately 10 water + 100 alcohol in alcohol jug. If we thoroughly mix it, it means that in every 10 volume of liquid in alcohol jug, we have 10/11 unit of water. if we transfer the 10 volume of water back we are efficiently transferring 100/11 alcohol. now, since we have 100/11 alcohol in total 100 of liquid back in water jug, we then have 1/11 concentration.

## 1.2

> ANSWER  
by the time Myron reached the top, when he counted 25 steps, Fischer would have stepped 25*2/3 -> 50/3 steps. At 50/3 steps, since Fischer counted 20 steps, he would have had time for 10/3 steps left. 25 + k = 50/3 + 10/3 + k + k/5 -> 5 = 5/k -> k = 25
50 steps are showing.

## 1.3
> ANSWER  
One rings each 12 seconds, one rings each 15 seconds. LCM(12, 15) = 60 

## 1.4

> 5050

## 1.5 

> ANSWER  
Think of averages. if the top 4 were to fall together, the middle 4 would compensate by +1 +2 -1 -2 

## 1.6

> ANSWER    
This one was hard. Mark the marbles with numbers, and then make a chart. Each marble has an equal chance of being either heavy or light. Compare in groups of 4, then you can mix and match. if equal, get 3 of what is left and compare with normal marbles.

## 1.7


> ANSWER  
since the radius of the circle is equal in all angles, make a right triangle with sides r, (r-10), and (r-5). use pythagorean theorem to find r, and since S = 2r, 50.

## 1.8


> ANSWER  
Let us imageine that we were able to unfold the cubic room. now, the extreme opposite corner in a cubic room is two "faces" away from me, and the shortest path on that unfolded room would also be the shortest path in folded cubic room. Thus, I would walk to the right, slightly up(angled so that I would reach the ceiling in two "Faces").

## 1.9



> ANSWER  
100000 or million, if the chances of getting a boy is equal, every additional population will yield the same number of boys and girls, thus yielding 50% every time.


## 1.10


> ANSWER  
10^3 - 8^3 = 488

## 1.11

> ANSWER  
2 things: having a full truck is the most efficient way of transporting apples. Thus, the checkpoitns should be where N*1000 apples can be dropped off. Now, we can drop off 2000 apples at mark 333, and then we have 2000 apples to transport for 666 miles. Now, transport 2000 apples for 500 miles, we have 1000 apples at mark 500, with 166 left. thus, transport the remaining 1000 apples -> 1000-166 = 836 apples.

## 1.12

> ANSWER  
Each hour has 360/12 = 30 degree angle. Thus, since during the 15 minutes the hour hand of the clock would have moved 30/4 degrees, and the 15 minute mark is at the 3 o'clock mark, we have 7.5 degree difference between the hands in an ideal clock.

## 1.13


> ANSWER  
The hour hand and minute hand must meet between 3~4 hour mark, so my naive guess would be at around 17 minutes.
The hour hand moves 0.5 degrees per minute, whereas the minute hand moves 360/60 = 6 degrees per minute. Thus, 6x = 0.5x + 90, 5.5x = 90, 90/5.5 = 16.36 minutes. My guess reasonably confirms this.

## 1.14 

> ANSWER  
We only have to consider until 64. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 flips the bulb. thus, it is on. 

## 1.15


> ANSWER  
I would think that it would need a odd number of factors below 100. square numbers would be on. 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 

## 1.16 
Your bedroom sock drawer contains eight red socks and 11 

> ANSWER  
No matter how many socks we choose, if we choose 3 socks, at least 2 must be the same color. Thus, we have a pair.

## 1.17
> ANSWER  
Again, by the pigeonhole principle at most N socks chosen can be different. Thus, if we choose N+1 socks, we have a guaranteed pair

## 1.18
> ANSWER  
we have a total of 10 colors. thus, if we choose 13 socks, we are guaranteed 3 pairs. 

## 1.19
> ANSWER  
I think a good point to make here is that I do not want to say any number above 40. In addition, I am guaranteed a win if I can say the number 39, since the minimum number the opponent can say is 40, which guarantees me a win, and maximum is 49, which guarantees a win for me yet does not give them a chance to win. Using that same algorithm, if I want 39, I want to say 28, and so on until 17, and 6. if I say 6, I can say 17 for sure, and if I say 17, i can say 28 for sure, and if I say 28, 39 and then 50. Thus, I want to go first and say 6. 

## 1.20 
> ANSWER 
40 * 40 * 40 -> last one doesn't matter since I can turn it until it opens, so 1600.
