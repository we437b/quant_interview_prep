You are given two glass jugs. Each contains the same volume, V , of liquid. One jug contains pure alcohol, and the other jug contains pure water. A modest quantity, Q, of water is poured from the water jug into the alcohol jug, which is then thoroughly mixed. The same modest quantity, Q, of (now diluted) alcohol is then poured back into the water jug to equalize the volumes of the jugs at their initial levels.
The initial concentration of alcohol in the alcohol jug equals the initial concen- tration of water in the water jug (at 100%). What is the relationship between the final concentrations of alcohol in the alcohol jug and water in the water jug?

> ANSWER
Let us consider that each of the jugs consider 100 units of pure water and pure alcohol. Now given that we have moved a modes quantity, lets say 10 percent of the liquid volume, of water has been transferred to the alcohol jug, and thoroughly mixed. Now, we have approximately 10 water + 100 alcohol in alcohol jug. If we thoroughly mix it, it means that in every 10 volume of liquid in alcohol jug, we have 10/11 unit of water. if we transfer the 10 volume of water back we are efficiently transferring 100/11 alcohol. now, since we have 100/11 alcohol in total 100 of liquid back in water jug, we then have 1/11 concentration.

Fischer and Myron just stepped side-by-side onto a moving es- calator. They are climbing up the stairs, and counting steps as they climb. Myron is climbing more quickly than Fischer. Myron climbs three steps in the time it takes Fischer to climb only two steps. Neither of them skips any steps. Myron steps off at the top, having counted 25 steps. He waits at the top for the slower Fischer, who steps off having counted only 20 steps. How many steps are showing on the escalator at any instant?  

> ANSWER  
by the time Myron reached the top, when he counted 25 steps, Fischer would have stepped 25*2/3 -> 50/3 steps. At 50/3 steps, since Fischer counted 20 steps, he would have had time for 10/3 steps left. 25 + k = 50/3 + 10/3 + k + k/5 -> 5 = 5/k -> k = 25
50 steps are showing.

There are two bells. One rings five times per minute, and the other rings four times per minute. If they start at the same time, how long will it be until they next ring together?
> ANSWER  
One rings each 12 seconds, one rings each 15 seconds. LCM(12, 15) = 60
